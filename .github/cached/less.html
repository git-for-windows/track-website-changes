less-440 fixes a bug in less-438 and, at the risk of some feature creep,

The -A option changes search behavior so that an initial search
includes the entire displayed screen and does not skip the first
line as is currently done.
Non-initial searches (for example, the "n" command) continue to 
skip the first (target) line to allow searches to proceed past
