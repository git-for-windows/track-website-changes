This version changes the new M command to take a mark letter, making it similar to the m command,
except the M command marks the bottom line on the screen rather than top line.
This version also adds a command ESC-m to remove a mark, 
fixes a bug that caused an erroneous binary file warning when viewing a UTF-8 file containing SGR sequences,
and now correctly handles the keypad Enter key.

less-440 fixes a bug in less-438 and, at the risk of some feature creep,
adds one much requested feature.
The -A option changes search behavior so that an initial search
includes the entire displayed screen and does not skip the first
line as is currently done.
Non-initial searches (for example, the "n" command) continue to 
skip the first (target) line to allow searches to proceed past 
the current screen.
