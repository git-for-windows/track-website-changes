  <h1>PCRE - Perl Compatible Regular Expressions</h1>

  <p>The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular
   expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as
   Perl&nbsp;5. PCRE has its own native API, as well as a set of
   wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression
   API. The PCRE library is free, even for building proprietary
   software.</p>

  <p>PCRE was originally written for the
   <a href="https://www.exim.org/">Exim MTA</a>,
   but is now used by many high-profile open source projects, including
   <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>,
   <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>,
   <a href="https://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>,
   <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>, and
   <a href="https://nmap.org/">Nmap</a>.
   PCRE has also found its way into some well known commercial products, like
   <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">Apple Safari</a>.
   Some other interesting projects using PCRE include
   <a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/">Chicken</a>,
   <a href="http://www.canonware.com/onyx/">Onyx</a>,
   <a href="http://www.hypermail-project.org/">Hypermail</a>,
   <a href="http://leafnode.sourceforge.net/">Leafnode</a>,
   <a href="http://www.askemos.org/">Askemos</a>,
   <a href="http://www.wenlin.com/">Wenlin</a>, and
   <a href="http://8th-dev.com/">8th</a>.</p>


  <h2>Versions</h2>

  <p>There are two major versions of the PCRE library. The current
   version, PCRE2,
   <a href="https://lists.exim.org/lurker/message/20150105.162835.0666407a.en.html">released in 2015,</a>
   is now at version <b>10.39</b>.</p>

  <p>The older, but still widely deployed PCRE library, originally
   released in 1997, is at version <b>8.45</b>. This version of PCRE is
    now at end of life, and is no longer being actively maintained. Version
    8.45 is expected to be the final release of the older PCRE library,
    and new projects should use PCRE2 instead.</p>


  <h2>Download</h2>

  <p>You can download the current release of the PCRE2 library from its
   official home on <a href="https://github.com/PhilipHazel/pcre2">GitHub</a>:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><b><a href="https://github.com/PhilipHazel/pcre2/releases">https://github.com/PhilipHazel/pcre2/releases</a></b></li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can also download PCRE2 or the older, unmaintained PCRE library from
   an <i>unofficial</i> mirror at
   <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcre/files/">SourceForge</a>:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcre/files/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcre/files/</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can check out the PCRE2 source code via Git or Subversion:</p>

  <blockquote><code>git clone https://github.com/PhilipHazel/pcre2.git</code></blockquote>

  <p>Note that the former <tt>ftp.pcre.org</tt> FTP site is no longer
    available. You will need to update any scripts that download PCRE source
    code to download via HTTPS, Git, or Subversion from the new home on
    GitHub instead.</p>
